My degree was in biological sciences covering hard sciences such as mathematics, statistics, physics and chemistry during the first year and half, moving on to specific subjects such as cell biology, plant and animal morphology, physiology, and diversity, genetics, microbiology, and ecology and environmental sciences.

I used quail as my animal model for chickens, due to their size and their reproductive cycle, allowing me to work with a relative large number of birds and following them throughout different life stages: eggs, chicks, and adults. Although my main work was done at the facilities and in the lab, I started my journey in statistics and programming. The experiments I carried out were quite complex, and the knowledge I had at that time did not allow me to properly analyse my data. I started with a basic diploma in R and RStudio, were I familiarised myself with the programming language, learning how to import data, visualise them, and run some simply statistical models.

I was looking for internships, secondments, or trainings in other countries. I started applying to different fellowships, without much luck. My supervisors at the time were aware of my interests and they suggested me applying to a European project working at the interplay of poultry science and poultry industry. There were 14 projects in total, with two projects catching my attention. These projects were data-driven with the opportunity to apply my current set of skills in statistical programming while acquiring additional ones.

The main topic of the new research project was on Bayesian networks, as an exploratory and graphical tool for decision making. I worked at the interplay of genetics and bioinformatics, with the additional component of the Bayesian networks. The project had two sides. On the one hand, I collected data from publicly available online data repositories, looking for experiments carried out in chickens and the effects of stress in gene expression. The overall idea was to provide a complemetary approach, by augmenting data and visualising interactions and interrelationships between genes and stress.
